# 2020_ROS_Robot
[![x86 Build Status](https://github.com/frcteam195/2020_ROS_Robot/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/frcteam195/2020_ROS_Robot/actions/workflows/main.yml)

This is the main robot project. All nodes used in the robot should be defined in ros_projects.txt and all third party libraries should be defined in third_party_projects.txt. In order to run this project, you need to have [ros_dev](https://github.com/frcteam195/ros_dev) at the same directory level as this repository. Then you can run `./ros_dev/mkrobot.sh clone` to pull all the node and third party libraries and then run `./ros_dev/mkrobot.sh build` to build all the nodes. To deploy to the ROS robot, run `./ros_dev/mkrobot.sh deploy`.
